# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # start dev server (Vite, hot reload)
npm run build    # tsc + vite build → dist/
npm run preview  # preview the production build locally
```

No test suite — verify features manually in the browser.

## Git workflow

After successfully implementing a feature (when the user accepts it without asking for changes or adjustments), automatically create a git commit on the `main` branch with a concise commit message describing what was added. Stage only relevant source files — not `dist/`. After committing, always state in the response that a commit was made and include the commit message.

**Never push** unless the user explicitly asks. The user handles all `git push` operations.

## Design system

All new UI must follow these tokens and patterns. Do not introduce new values — extend from these.

### Colors
```
background:   #0d0d0d   (--bg)
card outer:   #1c1c1c   (list row cards, sheet surfaces)
card inner:   #131313   (nested content box inside a card)
text:         #e8e8e8   (--text)
text dim:     rgba(232,232,232,0.35)  (--text-dim)
accent:       #f97316   (--accent, orange — numbers, counts, active states)
```

### Card / list row pattern
Every list row uses a two-level nested box:

| Layer        | `background` | `border-radius` | notes                          |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Outer card   | `#1c1c1c`    | `8px`           | `padding: 0 5px`, `margin-bottom: 5px`, `overflow: hidden` |
| Inner box    | `#131313`    | `3px`           | = outer(8) − padding(5); `margin-bottom: 5px` (creates bottom gap, contained by `overflow:hidden`) |

- Gap between outer edge and inner box: **5px on all four sides**
- `overflow: hidden` on the outer card is mandatory — it prevents `margin-bottom` on the inner box from collapsing through the outer, and clips inner corners cleanly.
- Inner `border-radius` formula: **outer_radius − side_padding** = 8 − 5 = 3px. Always derive it this way.
- Rows separated by `margin-bottom: 5px` (space, not a line/border).

### Row height
```css
.exercise-item { padding: 7px 0 5px; }   /* top 7px, bottom 5px */
```
Keep row padding in this range — don't add extra vertical space.

### Bottom sheet
```css
border-radius: 16px 16px 0 0;
z-index: 20;
```
Sheets slide up from the bottom. Multiple sheets are mutually exclusive (opening one closes others). Sheet height is measured from `heatmapRef.bottom` to `visualViewport.height` so it fits between the heatmap and the bottom of the screen.

### Bottom bar buttons
```css
color: rgba(232,232,232,0.38);   /* inactive */
color: var(--accent);             /* active / open */
```

### Ghost / suggestion text
```css
color: var(--text-dim);   /* inline ghost suffix */
```
Preset ghost blocks float absolutely below the triggering line using `top: calc(N * var(--editor-lh) * 1em)`.

### Typography scale (inside sheets)
```
title:        1.1rem  weight 600
row name:     0.92rem weight 500
meta (date):  0.72rem color rgba(232,232,232,0.35)
count:        0.72rem color var(--accent)
inner text:   0.78rem color rgba(232,232,232,0.38)
dropdown:     0.82rem
```

## Architecture

Single-page React 19 + TypeScript app, no backend. All data lives in `localStorage`.

**Data flow:**
- `utils/storage.ts` — read/write per-day workout text keyed as `workout_YYYY-MM-DD`
- `utils/parser.ts` — tokenizes and parses each line into `ParsedLine` (exercise name, weight, sets, reps, highlights). The parser is the core of the app; everything else derives from it.
- `utils/exercises.ts` — aggregates parsed data across days; `buildCatalog`, `getExerciseHistory`, `getDayVolume`, merge/delete helpers.
- `utils/presets.ts` — scans days for `#`-prefixed headers; `buildPresetCatalog`, rename/delete-label/delete-with-exercises.
- `utils/bodyweight.ts` — stores/retrieves bodyweight entries; used to compute volume for bodyweight exercises.
- `utils/aliases.ts` — user-defined exercise name aliases (e.g. "bp" → "bench press").

**Components:**
- `App.tsx` — all state: current text, view date (null = today), suggestions, save status, sheet open state. Handles swipe navigation, keyboard navigation, debounced auto-save (400 ms), and bodyweight extraction.
- `components/Editor.tsx` — textarea with overlay for syntax highlighting (orange numbers) and inline ghost text. Renders trend indicators (↑↓), "New exercise!" badges, and bodyweight hint per line.
- `components/Heatmap.tsx` — 21-week grid; cell color = volume (reps × sets). Clicking a cell sets `viewDate` in App.
- `components/ExerciseSheet.tsx` — bottom sheet: exercise catalog with sort, merge mode, per-exercise expandable history, nickname/delete dropdown.
- `components/PresetSheet.tsx` — bottom sheet: preset catalog with sort, always-visible exercise list per preset, rename/delete-label/delete-with-exercises dropdown.

**Key patterns:**
- `viewDate === null` means "today"; non-null means browsing a past day. The same `Editor` component handles both — past mode reads/writes `pastText` and suggests from `daysBeforeView` (all days strictly before `viewDate`).
- Suggestions (`getHashPresetSuggestion`, `getSuggestion` in App.tsx) are pure functions over `ParsedDay[]` (newest-first). `#` lines trigger preset ghost: bare `#` → show all, partial → narrow (multi = hint, single = fill).
- `parseLine(line, bodyweightKg?)` is the single source of truth for interpreting any line. Volume is `reps × sets`.
- Exercise name normalization: `normalizeName` lowercases and strips spaces — "Bench Press" === "benchpress".
- Preset name normalization: strip leading `#` and surrounding spaces, then lowercase — `"#home"`, `"# home"`, `"# Home"` all resolve to `"home"`.
